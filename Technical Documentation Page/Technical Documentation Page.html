                    <ul>
                        <li>CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.</li>
                        <li>CSS is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.</li>
                        <li>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.</li>
                        <li>This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</li>
